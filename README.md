# Sweetviz-Tutorial-Blog

Exploratory Data Analysis is the first stepping stone in the world of Data Science & Analytics/ML/AI. And it is one crucial skill to have, but as we start learning more and more, one finds the task of EDA to be a bit mechanical. By mechanical I mean - there are certain steps that we have to take irrespective of the what data set it is and we have to run through those bunch on functionalities and then from their result we try to understand the data and what it signifies or not.
<br><br>
So, why not simply have these functionalities run by itself on passing the dataset and we spend more time in understanding and making meaning out of the data. 
<br><br>
To achieve this goal, we have a very beautiful and helping library called sweetviz. It describe itself as "Sweetviz is an open source Python library that generates beautiful, high-density visualizations to kickstart EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) with a single line of code." And believe me it does what it claims to do, eventhough it is in beta phase as of today.
